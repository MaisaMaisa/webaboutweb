        <p>
            I’m interested in websites that are made as a companion to an event/specific sitaution/context;<br>
            as opposed to websites that are designed to last real long becase they're live/online + visible to the global audience. Design is an obligatory element of a website, even if you make a website that's meant to be a beautiful artwork.
