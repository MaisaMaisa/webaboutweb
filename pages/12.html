            <span class="website">rijksacademie.nl</span> is more expensive(45K euros for development + design).<br>
            Made in three months. <br>
            Made by a graphic designer who is a coding expert and a really bad teacher(classic). (An expert?)
        </p>
        <p>
            <span class="website">antikythera.xyz</span> is cheaper and costs the time it took to build it.<br>
            Built in one month probably (design might have lasted longer).<br>
            Made by a design technologist.
