    <title>A website about a website</title>

        <p>
            ..No website is authentic in the traditional sense of the word. None is made from scratch.<br>
            All websites are forged because they're made of parts available on the tech market. <br>
            ...in the process of authenticating a website, you need to authenticate all its parts. Each has to be written from scratch;<br>
            If all parts are authentic, you're looking at a really expensive website.<br>
            Meaning that the more expensive it is, the more authentic.<br><br>
            The main question is: <span class="highlight">Is it a cheap website or an expensive website?</span>
